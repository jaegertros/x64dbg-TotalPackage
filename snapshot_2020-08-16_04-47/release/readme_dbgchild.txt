# DbgChild - Debug Child Process Tool 

![](/Images/DbgChildProcess.png?raw=true) DbgChild is a stand alone tool for debugging child processes. DbgChild can be used in conjunction with a plugin for a debugger. Currently DbgChild supports a plugin for the x86/x64 x64dbg debugger. Support for DbgChild can be extended to OllyDbg and Immunity debugger if so required via crowdfunding:

# Features

* Hook process creation for x86 or x64 child processes
* Patching and unpatching of NTDLL process creation for x86 and x64 child processes
* Process watcher for auto launching of new x64dbg instance when child process detected
* Modify the suspend (pre) and resume (post) logic to adapt to your own requirements

# Content
The DbgChild comprises a number of components to accomplish the task of launching a new x64dbg instance when a child process is hooked and detected. These components are:

* CreateProcessPatch.exe - Hook ZwCreateUserProcess (two separate exe files for x86 and x64) and loads DbgChildHookDLL.dll
* DbgChildHookDLL.dll - (two separate dll files for x86 and x64) - outputs process id's to CPIDS folder
* NTDLLEntryPatch.exe - Patches or unpatches LdrInitializeThunk (two separate exe files for x86 and x64)
* DbgChild.dp32 - x64dbg plugin x86 
* DbgChild.dp64 - x64dbg plugin x64
* NewProcessWatcher.exe - Watches for new child processes from the CPIDS folder
* x64_post.unicode.txt - Support file
* x64_pre.unicode.txt - Support file
* x86_post.unicode.txt - Support file
* x86_pre.unicode.txt - Support file
